# ðŸ”“ TryHackMe Lab Walkthrough â€“ Vulnversity  

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This project is part of the **Offensive Pentesting Path** on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).  
The lab we are working on is **Vulnversity**, a beginner-friendly CTF room focused on web vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, and enumeration.  

For this walkthrough, I am using **Kali Linux on VirtualBox**.  
- Connection to the TryHackMe network is done via **OpenVPN**.  
- Alternatively, you can use the **AttackBox** (browser-based Kali provided by THM), which is already connected to the lab environment.

## ðŸš€ Step 1: Deploying the Target Machine  
The first step is to deploy the vulnerable machine provided by TryHackMe.  

- Start the machine from the THM portal.  
- Wait **1 minute** for the target IP to appear.  
- Allow **4â€“5 minutes** for the machine to fully boot.

After the waiting period, the target machine is up and ready for enumeration.

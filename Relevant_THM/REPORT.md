## Introduction

This lab simulates a *black box penetration test* against a client's environment that is due to be released to production in seven days.

### Scope of Work
- The client requested a full assessment of the provided virtual environment.
- Minimal information was provided to replicate the perspective of a malicious attacker.
- The engagement was conducted as a *black box penetration test*.
- The client required the discovery of *two flags (User.txt and Root.txt)* as proof of exploitation.

### Rules of Engagement
- Any tools and techniques were permitted, though manual exploitation was encouraged before automation.
- All vulnerabilities identified had to be reported, as multiple exploitation paths exist.
- The only in-scope target was the IP assigned to the VM.
- Deliverables included:
  - An *executive summary*
  - *Vulnerability & exploitation details*
  - *Remediation recommendations*

### Goal
The primary goal of this engagement was to obtain the *User* and *Root* flags while identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within the environment.

## ðŸ›  Step 1: Starting the Machine & Initial Recon

### 1. Start the machine from the TryHackMe interface.
   - If using your own VM â†’ connect via the THM VPN.
   - If using AttackBox â†’ no VPN needed, tools are pre-installed.

### 2. After starting, wait:
   - ~1 minute to get the target IP.
   - ~4â€“5 minutes for all services to initialize.

### 3. Perform an Nmap scan against the target IP:
```
nmap -A 10.201.66.41
```
ðŸ“· **Screenshot:**  Nmap scan output (Nmap_scan_1.png)

### Findings:
 - Port 80 â†’ Microsoft IIS 10.0 (web server).
 - Ports 135, 139, 445 â†’ MS RPC, NetBIOS, SMB (Windows file shares).
 - Port 3389 â†’ RDP (Remote Desktop).
 - OS Discovery: Windows Server 2016 Standard Eval, Workgroup: WORKGROUP.

## ðŸ›  Step 2: SMB Enumeration & Passwords File Discovery

### 1) Enumerate SMB shares (anonymous)
```   
smbclient -L //10.201.66.41 -N
```
ðŸ“· **Screenshot:** 

### 2) Connect to the 'nt4wrksv' share (anonymous)

smbclient //10.201.66.41/nt4wrksv -N


### 3) List files and download passwords.txt*
```
ls
get passwords.txt
```
ðŸ“· **Screenshot:**  screenshots/02_passwords_txt_list.png

### 4) View the downloaded file locally (attackbox)*

cat passwords.txt

### 5) Decode base64 entries (example; replace <BASE64_STRING> with value from your screenshot)*
```
echo "<BASE64_STRING>" | base64 -d
```


ðŸ“· **Screenshot:**  Chatgpt

### Observation:
 - The passwords file contained base64-encoded entries (decoded in the screenshot).
 - Despite decoding (see screenshot), using those credentials did NOT grant SMB access â€” appears to be a decoy designed to waste time.

## ðŸ”Ž Step 3: Expanded Port Scan for Hidden Services

- After realizing the SMB credentials were a distraction, I shifted focus to other possibilities.
- It's common for administrators (or CTF creators) to host services on unusual, high-numbered ports. 
- The initial nmap scan only covered the most common 1000 ports, so it would have missed anything outside that range.
- To address this, I ran an nmap scan specifically targeting the range 49000â€“50000.

### 1) Run nmap on the high port range
```
nmap -p 49000-50000 10.201.66.41 
```
ðŸ“· **Screenshot:** port_discovery

### Observation:
 - The scan output revealed an open port in the specified range.
 - Since the command used did not include service/version detection (-sV),
   the output only showed that the port was open.

### 2) Run a detailed scan with service detection on the discovered range
```
nmap -sV -p 49000-50000 10.201.66.41
```

### Observation:
 - This detailed scan confirmed that one of the open ports in the range was running an HTTP service (a webserver).
 - With this information, the next step was to investigate the web application hosted on that port.

## Introduction

This lab simulates a **black box penetration test** against a client's environment that is due to be released to production in seven days.

### Scope of Work
- The client requested a full assessment of the provided virtual environment.
- Minimal information was provided to replicate the perspective of a malicious attacker.
- The engagement was conducted as a **black box penetration test**.
- The client required the discovery of **two flags (User.txt and Root.txt)** as proof of exploitation.

### Rules of Engagement
- Any tools and techniques were permitted, though manual exploitation was encouraged before automation.
- All vulnerabilities identified had to be reported, as multiple exploitation paths exist.
- The only in-scope target was the IP assigned to the VM.
- Deliverables included:
  - An **executive summary**
  - **Vulnerability & exploitation details**
  - **Remediation recommendations**

### Goal
The primary goal of this engagement was to obtain the **User** and **Root** flags while identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations within the environment.
